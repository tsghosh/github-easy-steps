# What is Pull requests ?
>  Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary

## Pull requests are best for Shared Repository Model
  Teams and organizations collaborating using the [Shared Repository Model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#article-platform-nav), where everyone shares a single repository and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes for example

> <ins> Many open source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to notify project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.</ins>   

## Ways to create pull requests / contribute to a open source repository
1. Pull Request from a forked repository
    > There is no way to modify/change contents of file in open source repository without creating a fork.


2. Pull Request from a branch within a repository
    > create a branch from the latest commit on master
